# Working with `@context` files

> “Some quotations are greatly improved by lack of context.”
>
> ― John Wyndham, The Midwich Cuckoos

From the [previous tutorial](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Understanding-At-Context) we have generated two
`@context` files defining the context data entities which will be offered in our simple Smart Farm Management System.
This means that we have defined an agreed set of unique IDs (URNs or URLs) for all the data entities and every single
attribute within those entities so that other external applications will be able to programmatically understand the data
held within our broker.

For example, the attribute `address` is within our smart application is defined as follows:

```jsonld
"@context": {
    "schema": "https://schema.org/",
    "address": "schema:address"
}
```

Which means that every `address` attribute follows the definition as defined by `schema.org`:

`https://schema.org/address` :

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Getting-Started/img/address.png)

A program written by a third party would therefore be able to extract information such the fact an `address` attribute
holds a JSON object with a sub-attribute containing the `streetAddress` by referring to the full
[schema.org **JSON-LD** schema](https://schema.org/version/latest/schemaorg-current-http.jsonld)

```jsonld
{
  "@id": "http://schema.org/streetAddress",
  "@type": "rdf:Property",
  "http://schema.org/domainIncludes": {
    "@id": "http://schema.org/PostalAddress"
  },
  "http://schema.org/rangeIncludes": {
    "@id": "http://schema.org/Text"
  },
  "rdfs:comment": "The street address. For example, 1600 Amphitheatre Pkwy.",
  "rdfs:label": "streetAddress"
}
```

This is the **JSON-LD** programmatic syntax allowing computers to extract meaningful data. _The attribute
`address.streetAddress` is a street_ directly without the need for human intervention.

Imagine the case where a company is contracting agricultural labourers. The farmer will need to be billed for the work
done. If such a system is built on JSON-LD, it does not matter if the farmer's Farm Management Information System
assigns different names to the attributes of the billing address provided that the farmer and contractor can agree on
the well-defined URNs for each attribute as **JSON-LD** can easily translate between the two formats using common
expansion and compaction algorithms.

## NGSI-LD Rules

**NGSI-LD** is a formally structured _extended subset_ of **JSON-LD**. Therefore **NGSI-LD** offers all the
interoperability and flexibility of **JSON-LD** itself. It also defines its own core `@context` which cannot be
overridden for **NGSI-LD** operations. This means that **NGSI-LD** users agree to a common well-defined set of rules for
structuring their data, and then supplement this with the rest of the **JSON-LD** specification.

Whilst interacting directly with **NGSI-LD** interface of the context broker the additional **NGSI-LD** rules must be
respected. However after the data has been extracted it is possible to loosen this requirement and pass the results to
third parties as **JSON-LD**.

This tutorial is a simple introduction to the rules and restrictions behind **NGSI-LD** and will create some **NGSI-LD**
entities and then extract the data in different formats. The two main data formats are _normalized_ and
_key-value-pairs_. Data returned in the _normalised_ format respects the **NGSI-LD** rules and may be used directly by
another context broker (or any other component offering an **NGSI-LD** interface). Data returned in the
_key-value-pairs_ format is by definition not **NGSI-LD**.

## Content Negotiation and the `Content-Type` and `Accept` Headers

During content negotiation, **NGSI-LD** offers data in one of three formats, these effect the structure of the payload
body.

-   `Accept: application/json` - the response is in **JSON** format
-   `Accept: application/ld+json` - the response is in **JSON-LD** format
-   `Accept: application/geo+json` - the response is in **GeoJSON** or **GeoJSON-LD** format

The major difference between **JSON** format and **JSON-LD** format, is that if **JSON-LD** format is chosen, then the
`@context` is found as an additional attribute within the body of the response. If the **JSON** only format is used the
`@context` is passed as an additional `Link` Header element and is not found in the response body.

Similarly when sending **NGSI-LD** data to the context broker, an application may choose to send a payload including an
additional `@context` attribute (in which case `Content-Type: application/ld+json`) or the application may send NGSI-LD
data without an additional `@context` attribute (in which case `Content-Type: application/json` and the `Link` header
must also be present).

The **GeoJSON** format is only used when querying a context broker for existing data and returns the context in a format
suitable for GIS systems. It is a recent addition to the **NGSI-LD** specification and therefore will not be discussed
further here.

# Prerequisites

## Docker

To keep things simple all components will be run using [Docker](https://www.docker.com). **Docker** is a container
technology which allows to different components isolated into their respective environments.

-   To install Docker on Windows follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/)
-   To install Docker on Mac follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/)
-   To install Docker on Linux follow the instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

**Docker Compose** is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. A
[YAML file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Fiware/tutorials.Getting-Started/NGSI-LD/docker-compose/orion-ld.yml) is
used configure the required services for the application. This means all container services can be brought up in a
single command. Docker Compose is installed by default as part of Docker for Windows and Docker for Mac, however Linux
users will need to follow the instructions found [here](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

## Cygwin

We will start up our services using a simple bash script. Windows users should download [cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com/)
to provide a command-line functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.

# Architecture

The demo application will send and receive NGSI-LD calls to a compliant context broker. Since the standardized NGSI-LD
interface is available across multiple context brokers, so we only need to pick one - for example the
[Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The application will therefore only make use of
one FIWARE component.

Currently, the Orion Context Broker relies on open source [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) technology to keep
persistence of the context data it holds.

To promote interoperability of data exchange, NGSI-LD context brokers explicitly expose a
[JSON-LD `@context` file](https://json-ld.org/spec/latest/json-ld/#the-context) to define the data held within the
context entities. This defines a unique URI for every entity type and every attribute so that other services outside of
the NGSI domain are able to pick and choose the names of their data structures. Every `@context` file must be available
on the network. In our case the tutorial application will be used to host a series of static files.

Therefore, the architecture will consist of three elements:

-   The [Orion Context Broker](https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which will receive requests using
    [NGSI-LD](https://forge.etsi.org/swagger/ui/?url=https://forge.etsi.org/rep/NGSI-LD/NGSI-LD/raw/master/spec/updated/generated/full_api.json)
-   The underlying [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database :
    -   Used by the Orion Context Broker to hold context data information such as data entities, subscriptions and
        registrations
-   An HTTP **Web-Server** which offers static `@context` files defining the context entities within the system.
-   The **Tutorial Application** does the following:

Since all interactions between the three elements are initiated by HTTP requests, the elements can be containerized and
run from exposed ports.

![](https://fiware.github.io/tutorials.Getting-Started/img/architecture-ld.png)

The necessary configuration information can be seen in the services section of the associated `orion-ld.yml` file:

```yaml
orion:
    image: fiware/orion-ld
    hostname: orion
    container_name: fiware-orion
    depends_on:
        - mongo-db
    networks:
        - default
    ports:
        - "1026:1026"
    command: -dbhost mongo-db -logLevel DEBUG
    healthcheck:
        test: curl --fail -s http://orion:1026/version || exit 1
```

```yaml
mongo-db:
    image: mongo:4.2
    hostname: mongo-db
    container_name: db-mongo
    expose:
        - "27017"
    ports:
        - "27017:27017"
    networks:
        - default
```

```yaml
ld-context:
    image: httpd:alpine
    hostname: context
    container_name: fiware-ld-context
    ports:
        - "3004:80"
```

All containers are residing on the same network - the Orion Context Broker is listening on Port `1026` and MongoDB is
listening on the default port `27017` and the httpd web server is offering `@context` files on port `80`. All containers
are also exposing ports externally - this is purely for the tutorial access - so that cUrl or Postman can access them
without being part of the same network. The command-line initialization should be self explanatory.

# Start Up

All services can be initialised from the command-line by running the
[services](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Getting-Started/blob/NGSI-LD/services) Bash script provided within the
repository. Please clone the repository and create the necessary images by running the commands as shown:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Getting-Started.git
cd tutorials.Getting-Started
git checkout NGSI-LD

./services orion|scorpio|stellio
```

> **Note:** If you want to clean up and start over again you can do so with the following command:
>
> ```
> ./services stop
> ```

# Creating NGSI-LD data entities.

This tutorial creates some initial farm building entities to be used by the Farm Management system.

## Prerequisites

Once the services have started up, and before interacting with the context broker itself, it is useful to check that the
necessary prerequisites are in place.

### Reading `@context` files

Three `@context` files have been generated and hosted on the tutorial application. They serve different roles.

-   [`ngsi-context.jsonld`](http://localhost:3000/data-models/ngsi-context.jsonld) -The **NGSI-LD** `@context` serves to
    define all attributes when sending data to the context broker or retrieving data in _normalized_ format. This
    `@context` must be used for all **NGSI-LD** to **NGSI-LD** interactions

-   The **JSON-LD** `@context` can be used when querying the data and returning _key-values_ data. Responses are
    **JSON** or **JSON-LD** and the data can be easily ingested and processed further by the receiving application.

    -   [`json-context.jsonld`](http://localhost:3000/data-models/json-context.jsonld) is a richer **JSON-LD**
        definition of the attributes of the data models.
    -   [`alternate-context.jsonld`](http://localhost:3000/data-models/alternate-context.jsonld) is an alternative
        **JSON-LD** definition of the attributes of the data models used by a third-party (the German sub-contractor of
        farm labourers). Internally their billing application used different short names for attributes. Their
        `@context` file reflects the agreed mapping between attribute names.

The full data model description for a **Building** entity as used in this tutorial can be found
[here](https://ngsi-ld-tutorials.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datamodels.html#building) it is based on the standard Smart
Data Models definition. A
[Swagger Specification](https://petstore.swagger.io/?url=https://smart-data-models.github.io/dataModel.Building/Building/swagger.yaml)
of the same model is also available, and would be use to generate code stubs in a full application.

### Checking the service health

As usual, you can check if the Orion Context Broker is running by making an HTTP request to the exposed port:

#### :one: Request:

```console
curl -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/version'
```

#### Response:

The response will look similar to the following:

```json
{
    "orion": {
        "version": "1.15.0-next",
        "uptime": "0 d, 3 h, 1 m, 51 s",
        "git_hash": "af440c6e316075266094c2a5f3f4e4f8e3bb0668",
        "compile_time": "Tue Jul 16 15:46:18 UTC 2019",
        "compiled_by": "root",
        "compiled_in": "51b4d802385a",
        "release_date": "Tue Jul 16 15:46:18 UTC 2019",
        "doc": "https://fiware-orion.readthedocs.org/en/master/"
    }
}
```

The format of the version response has not changed. The `release_date` must be 16th July 2019 or later to be able to
work with the requests defined below.

### Creating Data entities

New context data entities can be created by making a POST request to the `/ngsi-ld/v1/entities` endpoint and supply an
`@context` along with structured **NGSI-LD** data.

#### :two: Request:

> **Note:** This entity is being created using the default **normalized** NGSI-LD format, which is the Gold Standard for
> data exchange between context brokers. NGSI-LD supports two lossless data formats
> [normalized](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.CRUD-Operations/tree/NGSI-LD) and
> [concise](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Concise-Format/tree/NGSI-LD).
>
> In concise format, the addition of `"type": "Property"` is implied for each attribute with a `value`. However in
> normalized format, the redundancy of adding the `type` is useful for receiving microservices to be able to understand
> the difference between context data attributes and links between data entities (which are defined using
> `"type": "Relationship"`) and are discussed in a
> [later tutorial](https://github.com/FIWARE/tutorials.Entity-Relationships/tree/NGSI-LD)
>
> There are also several subtypes of _Property_ available:
>
> -   `"type": "GeoProperty"` for Geographic information
> -   `"type": "LanguageProperty"` for Multi-language Strings
> -   `"type": "VocabProperty"` for enumerated values
>
> More details can be found in later tutorials.

```console
curl -iX POST 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/ld+json' \
--data-raw '{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:farm001",
    "type": "Building",
    "category": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": ["farm"]
    },
    "address": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": {
            "streetAddress": "Großer Stern 1",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "verified": {
            "type": "Property",
            "value": true
        }
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "GeoProperty",
        "value": {
             "type": "Point",
             "coordinates": [13.3505, 52.5144]
        }
    },
    "name": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": "Victory Farm"
    },
    "@context": "http://context/ngsi-context.jsonld"
}'
```

The first request will take some time, as the context broker must navigate and load all of the files mentioned in the
`@context`.

Since the `Content-Type: application/ld+json` the `@context` is supplied in the body of the request. As with all
**NGSI-LD** interactions, the core **NGSI-LD** `@context`
([`https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.3.jsonld`](https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.3.jsonld))
is implicitly included as well.

This means that the actual `@context` is:

```jsonld
{
    "@context": [
        "http://context/ngsi-context.jsonld",
        "https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.3.jsonld"
    ]
}
```

with the core `@context` being processed **last** and therefore overriding any terms previously defined with the same
`@id`.

#### :three: Request:

Each subsequent entity must have a unique `id` for the given `type`

```console
curl -iX POST 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/ngsi-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
--d '{
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn002",
    "type": "Building",
    "category": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": ["barn"]
    },
    "address": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": {
            "streetAddress": "Straße des 17. Juni",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "verified": {
            "type": "Property",
            "value": true
        }
    },
     "location": {
        "type": "GeoProperty",
        "value": {
             "type": "Point",
              "coordinates": [13.3698, 52.5163]
        }
    },
    "name": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": "Big Red Barn"
    }
}'
```

In this second case the `Content-Type: application/json` so the `@context` is supplied in the associated `Link` header
of the request and not in the payload body.

### Using core `@context` - defining NGSI-LD entities

The core `@context` supplies the vocabulary for creating **NGSI-LD** data entities. Attributes such as `id` and `type` (
which should be familiar to anyone who has used NGSI v2) are mapped to the standard **JSON-LD** `@id` and `@type`
[keywords](https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#syntax-tokens-and-keywords). The `type` should refer to an included
data model, in this case `Building` is being used as a short name for the included URN
`https://uri.fiware.org/ns/dataModels#Building`. Thereafter each _property_ is defined as a JSON element containing two
attributes, a `type` and a `value`.

The `type` of a _property_ attribute must be one of the following:

-   `"GeoProperty"`: `"http://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/GeoProperty"` for locations. Locations should be specified as
    Longitude-Latitude pairs in [GeoJSON format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946). The preferred name for the
    primary location attribute is `location`
-   `"Property"`: `"http://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/Property"` - for everything else.
-   For time-based values, `"Property"` shall be used as well, but the property value should be Date, Time or DateTime
    strings encoded in the [ISO 8601 format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) - e.g. `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ssZ`

> **Note:** that for simplicity, this data entity has no relationships defined. Relationships must be given the
> `type=Relationship`. Relationships will be discussed in a subsequent tutorial.

### Defining Properties-of-Properties within the NGSI-LD entity definition

_Properties-of-Properties_ is the NGSI-LD equivalent of metadata (i.e. _"data about data"_), it is use to describe
properties of the attribute value itself like accuracy, provider, or the units to be used. Some built-in metadata
attributes already exist and these names are reserved:

-   `createdAt` (type: DateTime): attribute creation date as an ISO 8601 string.
-   `modifiedAt` (type: DateTime): attribute modification date as an ISO 8601 string.

Additionally `observedAt`, `datasetId` and `instanceId` may optionally be added in some cases, and `location`,
`observationSpace` and `operationSpace` have special meaning for Geoproperties.

In the examples given above, one element of metadata (i.e. a _property-of-a-property_) can be found within the `address`
attribute. a `verified` flag indicates whether the address has been confirmed. The commonest _property-of-a-property_ is
`unitCode` which should be used to hold the UN/CEFACT
[Common Codes](http://wiki.goodrelations-vocabulary.org/Documentation/UN/CEFACT_Common_Codes) for Units of Measurement.

## Querying Context Data

A consuming application can now request context data by making **NGSI-LD** HTTP requests to the Orion Context Broker.
The existing NGSI-LD interface enables us to make complex queries and filter results and retrieve data with FQNs or with
short names.

### Obtain entity data by FQN Type

This example returns the data of all `Building` entities within the context data The `type` parameter is mandatory for
NGSI-LD and is used to filter the response. The Accept HTTP header is needed to retrieve JSON-LD content in the response
body.

#### :four: Request:

```console
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities' \
  -H 'Accept: application/ld+json' \
  -d 'type=https://uri.fiware.org/ns/dataModels%23Building'
```

#### Response:

Since no explicit `@context` was sent in the request, the response returns the Core `@context` by default
(`https://uri.etsi.org/ngsi-ld/v1/ngsi-ld-core-context-v1.3.jsonld`) and all attributes are expanded whenever possible.

-   `id`, `type`, `location` and `name` are defined in the core context and are not expanded.
-   `address` has been mapped to `http://schema.org/address`
-   `category` has been mapped to `https://uri.fiware.org/ns/dataModels#category`

Note that if an attribute has not been associated to an FQN when the entity was created, the short name will **always**
be displayed.

### Obtain entity data by ID

This example returns the data of `urn:ngsi-ld:Building:farm001`. The NGSI-LD `@context` is supplied as a
[`Link` header](https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkHeader) to define the entities returned. The `ngsi-context.jsonld`
`@context` file is just supplying short names for every attribute.

The full link header syntax can be seen below:

```text
Link: <https://fiware.github.io/data-models/context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json
```

The standard HTTP `Link` header allows metadata (in this case the `@context`) to be passed in without actually touching
the resource in question. In the case of NGSI-LD, the metadata is a file in `application/ld+json` format.

#### :five: Request:

```console
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/urn:ngsi-ld:Building:farm001' \
-H 'Accept: application/ld+json' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/ngsi-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"'
```

#### Response:

Because an `@context` file was supplied in the request, short names now are returned throughout the response. This
reduces the size of the payload and makes the data easier to manipulate.

Note that the inclusion of the core `@context` is always implied. It would be also possible to include both `@context`
files explicitly as element in the array of `@context` sent. The response is normalized **NGSI-LD** and therefore valid
**JSON-LD** as well, and the `@context` can be used by the receiving program for **JSON-LD** operations.

```jsonld
{
    "@context": "http://context/ngsi-context.jsonld",
    "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:farm001",
    "type": "Building",
    "address": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": {
            "streetAddress": "Großer Stern 1",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "verified": {
            "type": "Property",
            "value": true
        }
    },
    "name": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": "Victory Farm"
    },
    "category": {
        "type": "Property",
        "value": "farm"
    },
    "location": {
        "type": "GeoProperty",
        "value": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                13.3505,
                52.5144
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

### Obtain entity data by type

When filtering by `type`, a [`Link` header](https://www.w3.org/wiki/LinkHeader) must be supplied to associate the short
form `type="Building"` with the FQN `https://uri.fiware.org/ns/dataModels/Building`.

If a reference to the supplied data is supplied, it is possible to return short name data and limit responses to a
specific `type` of data. For example, the request below returns the data of all `Building` entities within the context
data. Use of the `type` parameter limits the response to `Building` entities only, use of the `options=keyValues` query
parameter reduces the response down to standard JSON-LD.

#### :six: Request:

```console
curl -G -X GET \
    'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/ngsi-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/ld+json' \
    -d 'type=Building' \
    -d 'options=keyValues'
```

#### Response:

Because of the use of the `options=keyValues`, the response consists of JSON only without the attribute definitions
`type="Property"` or any _properties-of-properties_ elements. You can see that `Link` header from the request has been
used as the `@context` returned in the response.

```jsonld
[
    {
        "@context": "http://context/ngsi-context.jsonld",
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:farm001",
        "type": "Building",
        "address": {
            "streetAddress": "Großer Stern 1",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "name": "Victory Farm",
        "category": "farm",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                13.3505,
                52.5144
            ]
        }
    },
    {
        "@context": "http://context/ngsi-context.jsonld",
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn002",
        "type": "Building",
        "address": {
            "streetAddress": "Straße des 17. Juni",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "name": "Big Red Barn",
        "category": "barn",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                13.3698,
                52.5163
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

### Filter context data by comparing the values of an attribute

This example returns all `Building` entities with the `name` attribute _Big Red Barn_. Filtering can be done using the
`q` parameter - if a string has spaces in it, it can be URL encoded and held within double quote characters `"` = `%22`.
Since `options=keyValues` is sent, this will effect the structure of the payload and we will need to supply a different
`@context` file - `json-context.jsonld`

#### :seven: Request:

```console
curl -G -X GET \
  'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/json-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/ld+json' \
    -d 'type=Building' \
    -d 'q=name==%22Big%20Red%20Barn%22' \
    -d 'options=keyValues'
```

#### Response:

The use of the `Link` header and the `options=keyValues` parameter reduces the response to short form key-values
**JSON-LD** as shown:

```jsonld
[
    {
        "@context": "http://context/json-context.jsonld",
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn002",
        "type": "Building",
        "address": {
            "streetAddress": "Straße des 17. Juni",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "name": "Big Red Barn",
        "category": "barn",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                13.3698,
                52.5163
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

This **JSON-LD** is no longer **NGSI-LD** (since the `type` and `value` elements have been removed) and the `@context`
used reflects this. The `json-context.jsonld` file does not merely define the attribute names, it also includes
additional **JSON-LD** information within it such as the following:

```json-ld
{
    "barn": "https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:building%3Dbarn",
    "category": {
        "@id": "https://uri.fiware.org/ns/dataModels#category",
        "@type": "@vocab"
    }
}
```

This indicates the `category` in this **JSON-LD** response holds an enumerated value (`@vocab`) and that the value
`barn` is defined by a full URL. This differs compared to the `ngsi-context.jsonld` `@context` file where all we can say
is that there is an attribute with the full URL `https://uri.fiware.org/ns/dataModels#category`, because in a
normalized **NGSI-LD** response the `category` attribute would hold a JSON object (with a `type` and `value`) not a
string.

### Using an alternative `@context`

The simple **NGSI-LD** `@context` is merely a mechanism for mapping URNs. It is therefore possible to retrieve _the same
data_ using a different set of short names.

The `alternate-context.jsonld` maps the names of various attributes to their equivalents in German. If it is supplied in
the request a query can be made using alternate short names (e.g. `type=Building` becomes `type=Gebäude`)

#### :eight: Request:

```console
curl -G -X GET \
    'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/alternate-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/ld+json' \
    -d 'type=Geb%C3%A4ude' \
    -d 'q=name==%22Big%20Red%20Barn%22' \
    -d 'options=keyValues'
```

#### Response:

The response is returned in JSON-LD format with short form attribute names (`addresse`, `kategorie`) which correspond to
the short names provided in the alternate context. Note that core context terms (`id`, `type` etc.) cannot be overridden
directly but would require an additional **JSON-LD** expansion/compaction operation.

```jsonld
[
    {
        "@context": "http://context/alternate-context.jsonld",
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn002",
        "type": "Gebäude",
        "adresse": {
            "streetAddress": "Straße des 17. Juni",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "name": "Big Red Barn",
        "kategorie": "barn",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                13.3698,
                52.5163
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

It should also be noted that the sub-attributes of the `addresse` have also not been amended, since `address` =
`addresse` = `http://schema.org/address` and this definition defines the sub-attributes.

### Filter context data by comparing the values of an attribute in an Array

Within the standard `Building` model, the `category` attribute refers to an array of strings. This example returns all
`Building` entities with a `category` attribute which contains either `commercial` or `office` strings. Filtering can be
done using the `q` parameter, comma separating the acceptable values.

#### :nine: Request:

```console
curl -G -X GET \
    'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/nsgi-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/ld+json' \
    -d 'type=Building' \
    -d 'q=category==%22barn%22,%22farm_auxiliary%22' \
    -d 'options=keyValues'
```

#### Response:

The response is returned in JSON-LD format with short form attribute names:

```jsonld
[
    {
        "@context": "http://context/ngsi-context.jsonld",
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn002",
        "type": "Building",
        "address": {
            "streetAddress": "Straße des 17. Juni",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "name": "Big Red Barn",
        "category": "barn",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                13.3698,
                52.5163
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

### Filter context data by comparing the values of a sub-attribute

This example returns all stores found in the Tiergarten District.

Filtering can be done using the `q` parameter - sub-attributes are annotated using the bracket syntax e.g.
`q=address[addressLocality]=="Tiergarten"`.

#### :one::zero: Request:

```console
curl -L -X GET 'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities/' \
-H 'Link: <http://context/json-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
-H 'Accept: application/ld+json' \
    -d 'type=Building' \
    -d 'q=address%5BaddressLocality%5D==%22Tiergarten%22' \
    -d 'options=keyValues'
```

#### Response:

Use of the `Link` header and the `options=keyValues` parameter reduces the response to JSON-LD.

```jsonld
[
    {
        "@context": "http://context/json-context.jsonld",
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:farm001",
        "type": "Building",
        "address": {
            "streetAddress": "Großer Stern 1",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",

                13.3505,
                52.5144
            ]
        }
    },
    {
        "@context": "http://context/json-context.jsonld",
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn002",
        "type": "Building",
        "address": {
            "streetAddress": "Straße des 17. Juni",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "name": "Big Red Barn",
        "category": "barn",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [
                13.3698,
                52.5163
            ]
        }
    }
]
```

### Filter context data by querying metadata

This example returns the data of all `Building` entities with a verified address. The `verified` attribute is an example
of a _Property-of-a-Property_

Metadata queries (i.e. Properties of Properties) are annotated using the dot syntax e.g. `q=address.verified==true`.

#### :one::one: Request:

```console
curl -G -X GET \
    'http://localhost:1026/ngsi-ld/v1/entities' \
    -H 'Link: <http://context/json-context.jsonld>; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context; rel="http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context"; type="application/ld+json"' \
    -H 'Accept: application/json' \
    -d 'type=Building' \
    -d 'q=address.verified==true' \
    -d 'options=keyValues'
```

#### Response:

Because of the use of the `options=keyValues` together with the Accept HTTP header (`application/json`), the response
consists of JSON only without the attribute `type` and `metadata` elements.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:farm001",
        "type": "Building",
        "address": {
            "streetAddress": "Großer Stern 1",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "name": "Victory Farm",
        "category": "farm",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [13.3505, 52.5144]
        }
    },
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn002",
        "type": "Building",
        "address": {
            "streetAddress": "Straße des 17. Juni",
            "addressRegion": "Berlin",
            "addressLocality": "Tiergarten",
            "postalCode": "10557"
        },
        "name": "Big Red Barn",
        "category": "barn",
        "location": {
            "type": "Point",
            "coordinates": [13.3698, 52.5163]
        }
    }
]
```

Note that the `@context` element has not been lost. It is still returned in the form of a `Link` header in the response.

### Filter context data by comparing the values of a geo:json attribute

This example returns all buildings within 800m the **Brandenburg Gate** in **Berlin** (_52.5162N 13.3777W_). To make a
geo-query request, three parameters must be specified, `geometry`, `coordinates` and `georel`.

The `coordinates` parameter is represented in [geoJSON](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946) including the square
brackets.

Note that by default the geo-query will be applied to the `location` attribute, as this is default specified in NGSI-LD.
If another attribute is to be used, an additional `geoproperty` parameter is required.

  -d 'geometry=Point' \
  -d 'coordinates=%5B13.3777,52.5162%5D' \
  -d 'georel=near;maxDistance==800' \
  -d 'options=keyValues'
```

#### Response:

Because of the use of the `options=keyValues` together with the Accept HTTP header (`application/json`), the response
consists of JSON only without the attribute `type` and `metadata` elements.

```json
[
    {
        "id": "urn:ngsi-ld:Building:barn002",
